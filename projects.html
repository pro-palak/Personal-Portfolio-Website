                <h3>AutoTrack: Embedded Autonomous Follower Bot</h3>
                <p>
                <strong>AutoTrack</strong> is a real-time embedded system project developed for a university assignment at the 
                <strong>University of Hertfordshire</strong>. Built on the Initio robot platform and programmed in ISO C, 
                the robot autonomously follows a target object using live camera input and maintains a safe distance using ultrasonic sensors.

                This project was submitted as part of an advanced embedded systems module and would not have been possible without 
                the <strong>expert guidance of Professor Raimund Kirner</strong>, whose support and provided libraries were instrumental 
                in achieving the final result.

                <h3>Parcel Management System</h3>
                <p>
                    For my assignment in <strong>Software Architecture</strong>, I designed and implemented a <strong>Depot Parcel Processing System</strong> 
                    to simulate the workflow of depot workers handling customer parcels. The application adheres to a <strong>three-tier 
                    architecture</strong> (presentation, logic, data) and employs the <strong>Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern</strong> to 
                    decouple the user interface from business logic, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system's core functionality revolves around key classes like <code>Parcel</code>, <code>Customer</code>, <code>QueueOfCustomers</code>, 
                    and <code>Log</code>, each implemented with deliberate design patterns. For instance:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Singleton Pattern</strong>: Applied to the <code>Log</code> class to guarantee a single instance for tracking events 
                            (e.g., queue entries, parcel processing) system-wide.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategy Pattern</strong>: Used for dynamic fee calculations based on parcel type (e.g., standard, express).</li>
                        <li><strong>Observer Pattern</strong>: Enabled real-time GUI updates by notifying the view layer of state changes in queues or parcels.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Java Swing GUI</strong> provides an interactive dashboard displaying:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Real-time customer queues with priority handling.</li>
                        <li>Parcel processing status (e.g., weight, fee, destination).</li>
                        <li>A logging panel for auditing system events.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Outcome</strong>: The project earned <strong>96/100</strong>, with praise for its robust architecture, 
                    adherence to design patterns, and intuitive UI. It underscored my ability to translate theoretical 
                    concepts (e.g., SOLID principles, layered design) into functional, maintainable software.

                <h3>Events Registration Websites and Apps</h3>
                <p>During my one-year student placement as an Event Technology Assistant at TAG, an award-winning entertainment travel and event management company, I was responsible for supporting a wide range of event technology services for high-profile clients across the UK, US, and Asia Pacific.</p>
                <p>I worked on 28 diverse projects, including events for major brands such as Lenovo, Hiscox, IATA, Epson, CDW, and Haier. My key responsibilities included:

                    Website Development: I built event registration websites using platforms like Eventsforce and WIX. I also enhanced websites with advanced CSS for better design and integration of backend tools via JavaScript.
                    
                    Email & Graphic Design: I created email templates using HTML and CSS, managing bulk emails and designing visual content such as banners, logos, and proposals using Photoshop and Canva.
                    
                    Event Apps & Floorplans: I developed event apps using All in the Loop, providing real-time updates and communication for attendees. Additionally, I designed event floorplans to ensure smooth logistics.
                    
                    Client & Supplier Coordination: I supported clients with technology requests, handled communications, processed invoices, and generated daily/weekly reports.
                    
                    Onsite Event Support: I provided technical support during events, ensuring that all event technology ran smoothly.</p>
                <p>Throughout my placement, I gained hands-on experience in event technology, problem-solving, communication, and teamwork while working under tight deadlines. I also had the opportunity to attend industry conferences like Event Tech Live and Tech London Conference, where I learned about the latest trends in event technology.</p>

                <h3>ActivitySense: Human Activity Classification</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>ActivitySense</strong> is a machine learning project that classifies human movement patterns (e.g., walking, running, resting) 
                    from sensor data using <strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</strong> for dimensionality reduction and 
                    <strong>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</strong> for classification. Developed in <strong>Python</strong> with <strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong>, 
                    the system processes real-world accelerometer/gyroscope datasets to demonstrate how raw sensor signals can be transformed 
                    into interpretable activity insights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Technical Implementation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Pipeline</strong>: Leveraged <code>pandas</code> for cleaning and normalizing noisy sensor data, handling missing values, 
                            and segmenting time-series signals into sliding windows for feature extraction.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dimensionality Reduction</strong>: Applied <strong>PCA</strong> to condense 30+ raw features (e.g., mean, variance, FFT coefficients) 
                            into 3 principal components, retaining 95% variance while reducing computational overhead.</li>
                        <li><strong>Model Tuning</strong>: Optimized SVM hyperparameters (<code>C</code>, <code>gamma</code>, kernel selection) via grid search, 
                            achieving 92% accuracy on test data. Compared performance against baseline models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression).</li>
                        <li><strong>Visualization</strong>: Used <code>matplotlib</code> and <code>seaborn</code> to plot PCA loadings, confusion matrices, 
                            and decision boundaries, emphasizing interpretability for non-technical stakeholders. Highlighted trade-offs between model complexity (e.g., RBF kernel vs. linear SVM) and real-time deployment constraints.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Outcome</strong>: The project not only achieved high classification accuracy but also served as a case study in 
                    <strong>end-to-end ML workflow design</strong>‚Äîfrom data wrangling to actionable insights. Techniques used here are directly 
                    applicable to wearable tech, healthcare monitoring, and IoT edge devices.
